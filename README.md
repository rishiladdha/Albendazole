# Albendazole
Long story short, a bunch of schools in Africa were selected for deworming treatment of the pupils. In 1998 pupils in one (treatment) group of schools received Albendazole, a very effective medicine for parasitic nematodes (worms) infesting our gut. Volunteers from the NGO organizing this made unannounced visits to all the schools and checked attendance of the pupils. This was used as a measure of "school participation" in the study. They also conducted some tests for academic skills in 1998 across the schools. These test scores were compared with another test conducted in 1996. 

Data used in this project is based on a study conducted by Edward Miguel and Michael Kramer. The published paper, along with the project brief and the dataset used have been uploaded.
